Effort to package GZdoom for debian

Currently targeted at GZdoom g4.3.3, since newer versions need zmusic, see 
https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=67489
https://github.com/coelckers/ZMusic/

TODO:
 Fix icon (taskbar/desktop icon)
 bump version to latest (g4.4.2)
	maybe package zmusic
		zmusic.h is needed for compiling gzdoom
		libzmusic.so is needed at runtime
